# CDJ-400-Converter
Simple MP3 converter for Pioneer CDJ 400.</br>
Adds the extension ".MP3" to each file in directory and sub-folder.</br>
Useful script if you move files between different OS and the CDJ doesn't recongize the file(s).</br></br>
N.b. Assumes each file is an actual MP3 file.</br></br>
